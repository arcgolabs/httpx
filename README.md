## Overview

`httpx` is a lightweight HTTP service organization layer built on top of Huma.
It gives you a stable **server/group/endpoint** API surface across multiple runtimes (std/chi, gin, echo, fiber), while still allowing direct access to Huma when you need it.

## Install

```bash
go get github.com/DaiYuANg/arcgo/httpx@latest
```

## Current capabilities

- Unified typed route registration across adapters (`Get`, `Post`, `Put`, `Patch`, `Delete`...)
- Adapter-based runtime integration (`std`, `gin`, `echo`, `fiber`)
- Endpoint/module organization with scoped registrars, metadata defaults, and limited auto route sugar (`Endpoint`, `Registrar`, `EndpointSpec`, `Auto`)
- First-class OpenAPI and documentation control (docs route exposure is adapter-owned)
- Typed Server-Sent Events (SSE) (`GetSSE`, `GroupGetSSE`)
- Policy-based route capabilities (`RouteWithPolicies`, `GroupRouteWithPolicies`)
- Conditional request handling (`If-Match`, `If-None-Match`, `If-Modified-Since`, `If-Unmodified-Since`)
- Route-aware observability helpers for Prometheus and OpenTelemetry
- `dix` integration helpers for lifecycle and listen wiring
- Direct Huma escape hatches (`HumaAPI`, `OpenAPI`, `ConfigureOpenAPI`)
- Optional request validation via `go-playground/validator`
- Route introspection API for testing and diagnostics

## Positioning (how to think about it)

- `Huma`: typed operations, schemas, OpenAPI/docs, middleware model
- `adapter/*`: runtime/router integration + native middleware ecosystem
- `httpx`: unified service organization API + exposes selected Huma capabilities
- `httpx/websocket`: lightweight websocket helper used directly at framework/router layer; it is intentionally not part of the typed route API
